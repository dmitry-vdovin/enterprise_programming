	      
	   The
class     
String    
includes  
methods   
for       
examining 
individual
characters
of     the
sequence, 
for       
comparing 
strings,  
for       
searching 
strings,  
for       
extracting
substrings
and    for
creating a
copy  of a
string    
with   all
characters
translated
to        
uppercase 
or      to
lowercase.
Case      
mapping is
based   on
the       
Unicode   
Standard  
version   
specified 
by     the
Character 
class. The
Java      
language  
proides   
special   
support   
for    the
string    
concatenat
operator (
+ ), and f
conversion
of   other
objects to
strings.  
String    
concatenat
is        
implemente
through   
the       
StringBuil
StringBuff
class  and
its append
method.   
String    
conversion
are       
implemente
through   
the method
toString, 
defined by
Object and
inherited 
by     all
classes in
Java.  For
additional
informatio
on  string
concatenat
and       
conversion

Specificat
otherwise 
noted,ч  a
null      
argument  
to       a
constructo
or  method
in    this
class will
cause    a
NullPointe
to      be
thrown.   
	      
	     A
String    
represents
a string i
the UTF-16
format  in
which     
supplement
characters
are       
represente
by        
surrogate 
pairs (see

Index     
values    
refer   to
char  code
units, so 
supplement

in       a
String.   
The String
class     
provides  
	      
	ethods
for       
dealing   
with      
Unicode   
code      
points    
(i.e.,    
characters
in        
addition  
to   those
for       
dealing   
with      
Unicode   
code units
(i.e.,    
char      
values).
